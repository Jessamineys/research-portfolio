        <h2 class="section-title">TL;DR</h2>
        <p>Faced with employers’ lack of trust in AI screening tools for large applicant pools, I led foundational research and design validation to deliver an AI-assisted, human-in-the-loop workflow with 4 core features, which achieved <strong>organization-wide visibility and cross-functional buy-in from 2 product teams and senior leadership at Indeed</strong>.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Problem Space</h2>
            <p>Finding the right candidates has always been a headache for employers. Even with all kinds of Application Tracking System (ATS) and algorithms available, employers struggle to translate their time and efforts spent on these tools into efficient hiring and decision-making. </p>

            <div class="problem-statement">
                <h3 class="challenge-title">The Challenge</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"> In large applicant pools, employers (EMPs) struggle to identify qualified candidates even with AI toolsdesigned to facilitate resume screening. Without clarity, context, and control, EMPs lack trust to evaluate candidates confidently with AI, leading teams to abandon the tool.</p>
                <p>We identified a <strong>gap</strong> in employer expectation and AI recommendations: despite internal data showing nearly 60% of applicants meet the listed qualifications, candidate quality remains the top employer complaint. The gap lies not in supply but in alignment: a disconnect between employer expectations and how the system surfaces matches.</p>
            </div>
            <p>How would we reimagine the current SMB employer experience to address these opportunities with GenAI at the core?</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Project Challenges & Constraints</h2>
            <p>After stakeholder meeting with Indeed Employer Labs, I have identified the following constraints:</p>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 2rem; line-height: 1.7;">
                <ol>
                    <li>Since Indeed has already been developing a conversation agent, solution needs to go beyond that</li>
                    <li>Given a less-than-5-month timeline for Capstone project, team can only focus</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <p>Considering the constraints and timeline, we decided to focus on the early stage of hiring before interviewing candidates.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">To answer our research questions and lay the groundwork for in-depth primary research on EMP pain points, we first conducted observational and secondary research to develop a broad understanding of the space.</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Reddit Analysis</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">I led the Reddit analysis, collecting 2,000+ posts via <strong>Reddit API</strong> to capture current discussions among job seekers and EMPs. I first used <strong>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)</strong> (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to rapidly identify groups of words that tend to appear together, which can then be interpreted as “themes." Then, I manually coded the posts based on the preliminary themes and derived insights based on the initial themes.</p>
